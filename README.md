# Z2D

A structured 24-week Python journey from first principles to practical tools.

## Purpose

This repository documents my progression from Python fundamentals to building real-world scripts and small products.

The goal is not just to learn syntax, but to build discipline, structured thinking, and applied problem-solving ability.

## Structure

- `week1/` – Variables, operators, conditionals, loops
- `week2/` – (coming soon)
- `products/` – Standalone mini-projects built during the journey

## Philosophy

- Build from first principles
- Commit consistently
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Progress over perfection
- Improve incrementally
